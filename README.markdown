rainbow-delimiters.el:
======================

RainbowDelimiters is a “rainbow parentheses”-like mode which highlights parentheses, brackets, and braces according to their depth. Each successive level is highlighted in a different color. This makes it easy to spot matching delimiters, orient yourself in the code, and tell which statements are at a given depth.

Great care has been taken to make this mode FAST. You shouldn’t see any change in scrolling or editing speed when it’s on even when working in delimiter-rich languages like Clojure, Lisp and Scheme.

You can customize the colors RainbowDelimiters uses. The default colors are intentionally subtle; they are unobtrusive enough to make the mode worth looking at even if you usually don’t like rainbow parentheses modes.

This is the official github repository for rainbow-delimiters. It is made available so people can easily contribute to the mode.

<br />
You can choose to enable it only in certain modes, or Emacs-wide:


* To enable it only in specific modes, add lines like the following:
<br /><code>(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)</code>


* To enable it for **all** programming modes, add the following line (emacs 24 or higher):
<br /><code>(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)</code>


* To activate the mode globally, add to your init file:
<br /><code>(global-rainbow-delimiters-mode)</code>


* To temporarily activate rainbow-delimiters mode in an open buffer:
<br /><code>M-x rainbow-delimiters-mode</code>
