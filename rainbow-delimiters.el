;;; Commentary:

;; This is a "rainbow parentheses" mode which includes support for
;; parens "()", brackets "[]", and braces "{}". It conveys nesting depth
;; by using a different color for each successive nested set of
;; delimiters. It highlights all statements at a given level using the
;; same color - if several statements are all at the same depth, they
;; will all be the same color.
;;
;; Great care has been taken to make this mode FAST. You should see no
;; discernible change in scrolling or editing speed while using it,
;; even with delimiter-rich languages like Clojure, Lisp, and Scheme.
;;
;; The ultimate goal for the mode is to be useful with a wide variety
;; of programming languages with optional semantics catered to each.
;;
;; Default colors are subtle, with the philosophy that it's better to
;; avoid being visually intrusive. Color schemes are always a matter of
;; taste.  If you take the time to design a new color scheme, please
;; share it (a plain-text list of colors is fine) on the EmacsWiki page!
;; URL: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RainbowDelimiters


;;; Installation:

;; 1. Place rainbow-delimiters.el on your emacs load-path.
;;
;; 2. Compile the file (necessary for speed):
;; M-x byte-compile-file <location of rainbow-delimiters.el>
;;
;; 3. Add the following to your dot-emacs/init file:
;; (require 'rainbow-delimiters)
;;
;; 4. Add hooks for modes where you want it enabled, for example:
;; (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
;;
;; - To activate rainbow-delimiters mode temporarily in a buffer:
;; M-x rainbow-delimiters-mode
;;
;; 5. When using a dark background, if delimiter colors seem washed out
;;   you may need to add the following to your dot-emacs and restart:
;; (setq-default frame-background-mode 'dark)
;;
;; This is because Emacs can guess frame-background-mode incorrectly,
;; causing rainbow-delimiters to use its light color scheme on dark
;; backgrounds.
;;
;; The light/dark color schemes differ only in their brightness level.

;;; Customization:

;; To customize various options, including the color scheme:
;; M-x customize-group rainbow-delimiters
;;
;; color-theme.el users:
;; If you use the color-theme package, you can specify custom colors
;; by adding the appropriate faces to your theme.
;; - Faces take the form of:
;;   'rainbow-delimiters-depth-#-face' with # being the depth.
;;   Depth begins at 1, the outermost color.
;;   Faces exist for depths 1-9.
;; - The unmatched delimiter face (normally colored red) is:
;;   'rainbow-delimiters-unmatched-face'


;;; Change Log:

;; 1.0 - Initial release.
;; 1.1 - Stop tracking each delimiter's depth independently.
;;       This had lead to confusing results when viewing clojure
;;       code. Instead, just color based on current nesting inside
;;       all delimiters combined.
;;     - Added 'all-delimiters' faces to apply a color scheme to
;;       all delimiters at once. Other faces inherit from this group.
;; 1.1.1 - Change color scheme to a lighter, more subtle style.
;; 1.1.2: (2011-03-25)
;;  - Add an unmatched-delimiter face and correct problem with
;;    coloring of text following unmatched closing delims.
;; 1.2: (2011-03-28)
;;  - Unify delimiter faces: all delimiter types now use the same depth
;;    faces, of form 'rainbow-delimiters-depth-#-face'.
;; 1.2.1: (2011-03-29)
;;  - Conform to ELPA conventions.
;; 1.3: (2011-05-24)
;;  - Add separate color schemes for light and dark background modes.
;;  - Checkboxes to enable/disable highlighting for each delimiter type.
;;  - Improvements to Customize interface.
;;  - Infinite depth support by cycling through defined faces repeatedly.
;;  - Documentation changes.
;; 1.3.1 (2011-05-25)
;;  - Light color theme appears entirely grey on SRGB monitors. Revert to
;;    old color theme until a nicer light background theme can be added.
;;  - Correct typo in the installation step for users of dark backgrounds.

;;; TODO:

;; - Add support for independent depth tracking for each delimiter type,
;;   for users of C-like languages.
;; - Add Python support - highlighting parens according to indentation level.
;; - Add support for nested tags (XML, HTML)
;; - Set up proper example color-theme.el themes for rainbow-delimiters mode.
;; - Intelligent support for other languages: Ruby, LaTeX tags, et al.

;;; Issues:

;; - Rainbow-delimiters mode does not appear to change the color of
;;   delimiters when Org-mode is also enabled.
;; - Some Emacs versions don't set frame-background-mode to dark automatically,
;;   causing users of dark backgrounds to receive the wrong set of colors.
;;   See step number 5 in the Installation section.
